                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
                <p>WhatIf is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, transmit to our servers, or share any of the following:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Actual investment portfolio data or holdings</li>
                    <li>Payment information</li>

                    <li>IP addresses or browsing history</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>We have no servers or databases storing your personal information.</strong></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
                <p>The App stores certain information locally on your device solely for functionality purposes. This data never leaves your device:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Search history:</strong> Stock and cryptocurrency ticker symbols you've searched (e.g., "AAPL", "BTC") are stored locally to provide quick access to recent searches</li>
                    <li><strong>Cached price data:</strong> Historical price data retrieved from third-party APIs is temporarily cached on your device to reduce loading times and API requests</li>
                    <li><strong>Calculation results:</strong> Your investment calculations and comparisons are stored locally for your reference</li>
                    <li><strong>App preferences:</strong> Your settings (such as preferred investment frequency or selected assets) are stored locally</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> All locally stored data is protected by your device's security features and is automatically deleted when you uninstall the App. No backup of this data is sent to our servers or iCloud.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Third-Party Data Services</h2>
                <p>To provide historical stock and cryptocurrency price data, the App sends requests to third-party financial data providers. These requests contain only:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Asset ticker symbols (e.g., "AAPL", "BTC", "ETH")</li>
                    <li>Date ranges for historical data</li>
                    <li>Standard HTTP request headers (user agent, timestamp)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>These requests do NOT contain any personally identifiable information about you.</strong></p>
                
                <p>We use the following data providers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Yahoo Finance</strong> - for stock market data</li>
                    <li><strong>CryptoCompare</strong> - for cryptocurrency data</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These third-party services may log API requests (including timestamp, requested symbols, and IP address) for their own operational purposes. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yahoo Finance: <a href="https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a></li>
                    <li>CryptoCompare: <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>WhatIf is available worldwide. When you use third-party data APIs, your requests may be routed through servers in various countries. Since we only send ticker symbols (not personal data), this does not constitute a transfer of personal information.</p>
