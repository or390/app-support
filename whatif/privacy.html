                <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
                <p>WhatIf is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal identification information</li>
                    <li>Email addresses or contact information</li>

            <section>
                <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
                <p>The App stores certain information locally on your device for functionality purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Recent searches:</strong> Your recent stock and cryptocurrency searches are stored locally on your device to provide quick access and improve your experience</li>
                    <li><strong>Cached data:</strong> Historical price data is temporarily cached on your device to reduce loading times</li>
                    <li><strong>App preferences:</strong> Your settings and preferences are stored locally</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data never leaves your device and is automatically deleted if you uninstall the App.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>The App uses third-party financial data providers to retrieve historical stock and cryptocurrency prices. When you search for an asset, the App sends requests to these services containing only the asset symbol (e.g., "AAPL" or "BTC"). These requests do not contain any personal information about you.</p>
                <p>We use the following data providers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yahoo Finance</li>
                    <li>CryptoCompare</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These services may have their own privacy policies regarding the data they collect from API requests. We recommend reviewing their policies if you have concerns.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>Since we don't collect or transmit your personal data to our servers, there is no centralized database that could be compromised. All data is stored locally on your device and protected by your device's security features.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

                <h2>Your Rights</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Clear the App's cache through your device settings</li>
