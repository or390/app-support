                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How accurate is the historical data?</h3>
                    <p>WhatIf uses real historical market data from trusted financial data providers. Stock prices are adjusted for splits and dividends to provide accurate calculations. However, this is for educational purposes only and past performance does not guarantee future results.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I use this for real investment decisions?</h3>
                    <p>WhatIf is designed for educational purposes to help you learn about market history and investment strategies. It should not be used as the sole basis for making investment decisions. Always consult with a qualified financial advisor before investing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why can't I find a specific stock or cryptocurrency?</h3>
                    <p>WhatIf covers major global exchanges and popular cryptocurrencies. If you can't find a specific asset, it may not be available in our data providers' coverage, or it may be too new or too small to have sufficient historical data.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is dollar-cost averaging (DCA)?</h3>
                    <p>Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount at regular intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly) regardless of the asset's price. This can help reduce the impact of volatility over time.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does the S&P 500 benchmark work?</h3>
                    <p>When you calculate an investment, WhatIf automatically shows how that same investment would have performed if you'd invested in the S&P 500 (via SPY ETF) instead. This helps you see whether your chosen investment beat the market.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does WhatIf store my data?</h3>
                    <p>WhatIf stores your recent searches and calculations locally on your device for convenience. We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal investment information to any servers. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>The app shows an error when I search for a symbol</h3>
                    <p>This usually happens if:<br>
                    • The symbol is incorrect or misspelled<br>
                    • The asset doesn't have sufficient historical data<br>
                    • There's a temporary issue with our data providers<br>
                    Try searching by the company/crypto name instead of the symbol, or try again later.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I compare more than two assets?</h3>
                    <p>Currently, WhatIf supports comparing two assets at a time. You can run multiple comparisons and share the results to keep track of different scenarios.</p>
