                    <h3>What does WhatIf do?</h3>
                    <p>WhatIf lets you simulate historical investment scenarios. You can see how much money you would have made (or lost) if you had invested in any stock or cryptocurrency at any point in the past. The app supports both one-time investments and recurring investments (dollar-cost averaging).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I calculate an investment?</h3>
                    <p>1. Select whether you want to check a stock or cryptocurrency<br>
                    2. Search for the asset by symbol or name (e.g., "AAPL" or "Apple")<br>
                    3. Choose between one-time or recurring investment<br>
                    4. Enter the amount and dates<br>
                    5. Tap Calculate to see your results</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I compare two investments?</h3>
                    <p>After calculating an investment, tap "Compare with Another Asset" on the results screen. Search for a second asset, and WhatIf will show you which investment would have performed better using the same investment amounts and dates.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How accurate is the historical data?</h3>
                    <p>WhatIf uses real historical market data from trusted financial data providers. Stock prices are adjusted for splits and dividends to provide accurate calculations. However, this is for educational purposes only and past performance does not guarantee future results.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is "If kept in cash" value?</h3>
                    <p>This shows what your money would be worth if you hadn't invested it, adjusted for inflation. It helps you see the real purchasing power impact of your investment versus just holding cash. The percentage shows whether inflation helped or hurt your cash value.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is dollar-cost averaging (DCA)?</h3>
                    <p>Dollar-cost averaging is when you invest a fixed amount at regular intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly) regardless of the asset's price. This strategy can help reduce the impact of market volatility over time by averaging out the price you pay per share.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I use this for real investment decisions?</h3>
                    <p>No. WhatIf is designed for educational purposes to help you learn about market history and understand how different investment strategies would have performed. It should NOT be used as the sole basis for making investment decisions. Always consult with a qualified financial advisor before investing real money.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why can't I find a specific stock or cryptocurrency?</h3>
                    <p>WhatIf covers major global exchanges and popular cryptocurrencies. If you can't find a specific asset:<br>
                    • It may not be available in our data providers' coverage<br>
                    • It may be too new to have sufficient historical data<br>
                    • It may be delisted or no longer traded<br>
                    • Try searching by the full company name instead of the ticker</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does WhatIf store my investment data?</h3>
                    <p>WhatIf stores your recent searches and calculations locally on your device only for convenience. We do NOT collect, store, or transmit your personal information or investment data to any servers. All data stays on your device. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How far back can I check historical data?</h3>
                    <p>This depends on the asset:<br>
                    • Major stocks: typically back to the 1980s-1990s<br>
                    • Some stocks: only to their IPO date<br>
                    • Major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH): back to 2010-2015<br>
                    • Newer cryptocurrencies: only a few years<br>
                    The app will show you the available date range when you select an asset.</p>

                <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Error: "Couldn't find data for [symbol]"</h3>
                    <p>This usually means:<br>
                    • The ticker symbol is incorrect or misspelled<br>
                    • The asset doesn't have sufficient historical data for your selected dates<br>
                    • Try searching by company/crypto name instead of symbol<br>
                    • Check if the symbol is correct on a financial website</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Error: "No internet connection"</h3>
                    <p>WhatIf requires an internet connection to fetch historical price data. Check that:<br>
                    • Your device is connected to WiFi or cellular data<br>
                    • You're not in airplane mode<br>
                    • Your connection is stable<br>
                    Once cached, you can view previous calculations offline.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Error: "Rate limit exceeded"</h3>
                    <p>Our data providers limit how many requests can be made in a short time. Wait 30-60 seconds and try again. If you see this frequently, try using assets you've recently searched (they're cached).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Error: "Server is temporarily unavailable"</h3>
                    <p>The data provider's servers are experiencing issues. Wait a few minutes and try again. This is usually temporary.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>The calculation seems wrong or unexpected</h3>
                    <p>Double-check:<br>
                    • Your start and end dates are correct<br>
                    • You selected the right investment frequency (one-time vs recurring)<br>
                    • The amounts are entered correctly<br>
                    • You're looking at the right asset (some tickers are similar)<br>
                    Remember: calculations include stock splits and dividends, which can make results different from just looking at price charts.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Data seems outdated or incorrect</h3>
                    <p>Try these steps:<br>
                    1. Force quit the app completely<br>
                    2. Reopen the app<br>
                    3. Search for the asset again (this fetches fresh data)<br>
                    If the problem persists, the data provider may have incomplete information for that specific asset.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>App is running slowly</h3>
                    <p>The app caches data to improve performance. If it's slow:<br>
                    • Restart the app<br>
                    • Make sure you have enough free storage on your device<br>
                    • Try a shorter date range for calculations (fewer data points)<br>
                    • Ensure you have a stable internet connection</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I clear my search history?</h3>
                    <p>Currently, search history is stored locally and cleared automatically when you uninstall the app. We plan to add a manual clear option in a future update.</p>
